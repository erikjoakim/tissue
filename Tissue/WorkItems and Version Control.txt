Version Control
==============
Ver alfa 0.1
Did a new implementation of Boundary Conditions. 
The tissue cells size is now increased to include the Boundary conditions, and the edges of the cells array are updated with the assigned BC object on each tick.


WorkItems
==============
Make sure the tissue can handle differet tissue sizes
Change the drawing of the tissue to allow for bigger or smaller tissues.

Make it possible to edit the thresholds for the Transfer Function

Update to make the values of the tissue take negativ and fractional values (see 2 below)

1.Implement Wrapping
2.Implement using double values
3.Implement functional Boundary Conditions
4.Implement Analysis Functions
	1. Calculate frequency or cycle period. 
	With which period do patterns return for whole or parts of the tissue
	2. Define different KPI for the tissue
	Wave patterns in different directions?
	Areas of standing waves?
	Average values of whole or parts of the tissue?
	etc
5.Implement Image feed boundary condition
	1. Includes to be able to feed a particular pattern as BC on a particular side.
6. Think about how to find output from the tissue...
	A feed of a circle should be somehow recognized..
