Version Control
==============
Next Version: 
Implement editable Boundary Conditions. Possibly also Boundary Conditions which can vary with time.
Implement wrapping.

Ver Alfa 0.1
Implemented simulation speed setting
Implemented editable BC
Fixed a few bugs in Tissue update and BC
Implemented BCWrapRight and Combobox to select BC Types
Implemented pink BC

Ver Alfa 0.1 015647b7
Corrected bugs related to BC. Now BC shows in grid and is correctly updated on Tick().

Ver. Alfa 0.1 305fa087
Implemented Thresholds in Tissue and Windows Interface

Ver alfa 0.1 8f5293f8
Did a new implementation of Boundary Conditions. 
The tissue cells size is now increased to include the Boundary conditions, and the edges of the cells array are updated with the assigned BC object on each tick.

BUGS??
=============
Should possible update BC AFTER cell update to prepare for next tick. May show up nicer in the graphics

WorkItems
==============
Make sure the tissue can handle different tissue sizes
Change the drawing of the tissue to allow for bigger or smaller tissues.

Make it possible to edit the thresholds for the Transfer Function

Update to make the values of the tissue take negativ and fractional values (see 2 below)

1.Implement Wrapping
2.Implement using double values
3.Implement functional Boundary Conditions
4.Implement Analysis Functions
	1. Calculate frequency or cycle period. 
	With which period do patterns return for whole or parts of the tissue
	2. Define different KPI for the tissue
	Wave patterns in different directions?
	Areas of standing waves?
	Average values of whole or parts of the tissue?
	Number of active cells
	etc
5.Implement Image feed boundary condition
	1. Includes to be able to feed a particular pattern as BC on a particular side.
6. Think about how to find output from the tissue...
	A feed of a circle should be somehow recognized..
7. Implement Transfer function that takes into account earlier states, that is the value of a particular cell at the state previous to this one.
	The transfer function needs to save a copy of the cell matrix. This will be like a first order derivate.
8. Implement Threshold function as separate Object.
9. Implement object to model functional values of cells for instance for the purpose of Boundary Conditions.
10. Implement 3D Tissues
